# gringobot

Bot with utilities for the Telegram Group [Programando na Gringa](https://go.d1m.dev/png)

This bot offer features that make the management of a large international group easier. We use it to add common questions and features that make the experience of our members more delightful.

All content is managed in markdown and is requested over the network through Github API's, so we don't have to redeploy the bot to have updated content.

The bot allows members to register the country they're located, so when questions about specific places come up, they can just use the bot to find those folks through a simple command like `/whoat NL` and ping them if needed with `/ping NL`

This bot is available in Telegram as [@PNGGringoBot](https://t.me/PNGGringoBot) and it works in multiple groups. Keep in mind that the admins of [Programando na Gringa](https://go.d1m.dev/png) own this instance as a community effort and manage the data accordingly. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

## Features

The bot currently replies in Portuguese by default, and parses names of countries in Portuguese only. This will change in the future.

## Developing

Make sure you have Git, Node and Yarn available in your local environment.

```sh
# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/armand1m/gringobot.git

# cd into it
cd ./gringobot

# install dependencies
yarn
```

You must have a Telegram Bot Token created by the Bot Father. Once you have that, run the following command with your bot token:

```sh
cat > ./.env <<EOL
NODE_ENV=development
BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here
DATA_PATH=./data
MESSAGE_TIMEOUT_ENABLED=true
MESSAGE_TIMEOUT_IN_MINUTES=2
HELP_COMMAND_ENABLED=true
EOL
```

Now run `yarn dev` and your bot should be working. Changes will restart the process.

## Deploying

### Host

Follow the same configuration step for development, but run the following to start the process:

```sh
yarn build
node ./build/index.js
```

You probably want to use a process manager like `systemd` or PM2.

### Docker

This bot is published publicly as a Docker Image, so you should be able to run it anywhere you can run a Docker Container.

To run it locally, just run the following:

```sh
docker run -e BOT_TOKEN="your-bot-token-here" armand1m/gringobot
```

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes manifests are available at the `./kubernetes` folder.

Create a secret named `gringobot-secret` with the `bot_token`:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic gringobot-secrets \
    --from-literal=bot_token='<token-goes-here>'
```

Then apply the manifest:

```sh
kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes/deployment.yml
```

You might have to adjust the PersistentVolumeClaim if you're not using a CSI driver.
